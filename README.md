# Modern Android Development - The Freeletics Way

At Freeletics use many of the Jetpack/AndroidX libraries but we don't
always use them in the way they are advertised in Google's tutorials.
This project show cases our own flavored version of Modern Android Development
as well as some of our own utilties.

**This repository is a work in progress. More will be added over time.**
